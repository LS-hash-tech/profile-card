        I am a graduate in Fashion Business & Management with a strong
        foundation in fashion history and business. During my college and uni
        years I launched my first solo-business and scaled it to 7k MRR. My
        second start-up, Rentierre, was a P2P fashion rental marketplace, I
        managed a team of 6 and got it to become revenue-generating on the
        second month after its launch. Now I am exiting, divided by two
        acquirers, one of which has already signed the APA and processed the
        payment. In recent years, I have transitioned toward the tech space and
        became passionate about building in the AI / Agentic domain. I approach
        life as a lifelong learner, driven by curiosity and a passion for
        pushing my limits.
