        I am a graduate in Fashion Business & Management with a strong
        foundation in fashion history and business. During my college and uni
        years I launched my first solo-business and scaled it to 7k MRR. My
        second start-up, Rentierre, was a P2P fashion rental marketplace, I
        managed a team of 6 and got it to become revenue-generating on the
        second month after its launch.

        At this stage I am exiting, with the acquisition split between two
        buyers, one of which has already signed the APA and processed the
        payment. Recently I have transitioned toward the tech space and became
        passionate about building in the AI / Agentic domain. I approach life as
        a lifelong learner, driven by curiosity and a passion for pushing my
        limits. You can find out more about what I have been up to via my
        Linkedin below.
